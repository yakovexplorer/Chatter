# Chatter - A basic chatting room

Chatter is a simple chat room application that allows users to join and leave chat rooms, send messages, and view active
users. The backend is built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and the frontend is built
with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

To get started with Chatter, follow these steps:

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatter.git
```

Next, navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd chatter
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, start the backend server by navigating to the `backend` directory and running `uvicorn`:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --port 80
```

Finally, start the frontend server by navigating to the `frontend` directory and running `python` (in a new terminal
window):

```bash
cd frontend
python main.py
```

After starting both servers, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the chat room.

>‚ùóÔ∏è Note: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
